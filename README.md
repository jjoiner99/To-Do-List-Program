# To-Do-List-Program
A C++ program used to create To-Do lists, and then export them to an external file on the user device.
To use this program, compile and run the .cpp file using a C++ compiler (such as GCC). You will then be prompted to create a list by first giving it a title, then entering the list items for the To-Do List. After you have finished creating your list, you can then choose to exit the program, which will result in your list being exported to the same directory as the program in the form of a .txt file, which you can then do with it what you will.
